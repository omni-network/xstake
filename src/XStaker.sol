/**
 * @title XStaker
 *
 * @notice Deployed on multiple chains, this contract is the entry / exit point for
 *      our cross-chain staking protocol. It accepts ERC20 deposits, and records
 *      them with the XStakeController on Omni. When a user unstakes on Omni,
 *      this contract pays out the widrawal.
 *
 * @dev Here we allow the user to specify the confirmation level for the xcall.
 *      The options are:
 *
 *      - ConfLevel.Finalized
 *          Strongest security guarantee - the xcall will be delivered exactly once.
 *
 *          It is only confirmed and relayed when the source tx is finalized.
 *          L2 txs are finalized only when posted to L1, and the corresponding
 *          L1 block is finalized. This can take 5-20 minutes.
 *
 *      - ConfLevel.Latest
 *          Weaker security guarantees - best effort delivery.
 *
 *          These xcalls are subject to reorg risk. It is possible that
 *          1. The xcall is delivered, but excluded from the canonical source chain.
 *          2. The xcall is included in the canonical source chain, but not delivered.
 *
 *          In scenario 1, our XStakeController will view this user as staked, but
 *          the user will still custody their tokens on the source.
 *  8
 *          In scenario 2, the XStaker will take custody of the user's tokens, but
 *          the XStakeController will not recognize the user as staked.
 *
 *      We can choose to reduce protocol risk, by requiring ConfLevel.Finalized for deposits
 *      over a certain maximum. Or, there are alternative protocol designs that can mitigate
 *      the impact of reorgs, and offer recovery mechanisms.
 *
 *      Finally, note that current reorg risk on today's L2s (like Optimism and Arbitrum)
 *      is low. Though it should remain a consideration.
